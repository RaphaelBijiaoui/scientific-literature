# Scientific Literature

This repository contains Jupyter/IPython notebooks, tables, images and
some other stuff originally written to help on understading some
academical/scientific texts I've studied.

As of today (June 2017), GitHub doesn't properly show the LaTeX
equations in the IPython notebooks when they have features like the
`\pmb` (poor man's bold) or the `\require` (an alternative to
`\usepackage` in MathJax since there's no *preamble* in the
notebooks), and also don't show the colored HTML messages, so you
have to either download the notebook to read it or to open it on the
[Jupyter Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org).

The notebook links below open each of them in the Jupyter Notebook
Viewer.
